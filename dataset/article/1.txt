Do you ever have a day where nothing of note really happens, but you still manage to accomplish all of your tasks? There's no excitement to break the monotony, but it was still undoubtedly a good day. Updated for 2025, the makes a similar case: There are minor exterior styling changes and a revamped interior, but mostly the Tucson finds success by getting the boring basics right.

## Slightly More Motivation

Hyundai didn't do much fiddling around under the hood of the 2025 Tucson. In standard trim, the Tucson is woefully slow, which is a shame considering the 's dynamics are otherwise plenty competitive. The 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine carries into the new model year unchanged. It pushes out a meager 187 horsepower and 178 pound-feet of torque.

The more powerful hybrid and plug-in-hybrid models benefit from slightly stronger electric motors than before. The plug-in is the most powerful Tucson and gains seven horsepower, now totaling 268 horses. The Hybrid Limited model we drove adds five horsepower, bringing it up to a total of 231. Both hybrids also earn 13 addition pound-feet of torque, for a total of 271 pound-feet, and mate to a six-speed automatic transmission.

We haven't had the chance to perform an instrumented test on the new version, but we don't think the minor output boost will do much to change the 7.1-second 60-mph time from the last hybrid model we tested. You won't win any stoplight drag races, but it's plenty of power for most people. All-wheel drive is optional on nonhybrid models and standard on the hybrids. Hybrid models (and the base-engine Tucson in the Limited trim) also get a new column-mounted gear selector.

Compared to the standard model's EPA estimates of 24 mpg city and 30 mpg highway, the Tucson Hybrid upper trims' 35/35 ratings mark a significant improvement. The hybrid's base Blue trim does even better, with EPA estimates of 38 mpg across the board. However, our previous real-world highway fuel-economy test of the hybrid model proved disappointing as we fell well short of the estimated figure (then 36 mpg), returning 28 mpg on our 200-mile loop. We'll see if the latest version can do any better when we get one in for testing.

There were no disappointments in the Tucson's driving experience. The ride is well mannered and, in our time driving the car through the hilly roads surrounding Santa Barbara, California, the suspension absorbed all but the worst impacts. While the handling won't quite win the Tucson any awards, the steering is direct and offers more feedback than is typical in the class. The power hand-off between the internal-combustion engine and the electric motor happens without fuss, and the electric motor has enough power to be the sole propulsion system even at highway speeds. The blending of regenerative and friction braking is similarly seamless and avoids any lurchiness that can be found in some hybrid systems.

Although the Tucson's throttle response is never very aggressive, Hyundai added a new drive mode to slow things down even further. Called Baby mode, the new drive mode reduces throttle tip-in to avoid disrupting your snoozing infant. While the drive modes change the pedal mapping and steering effort, they don't alter the suspension. You activate the new mode via the infotainment screen's menus rather than with the normal mode selector.

## Interior Upgrades

Speaking of screens, the Tucson has two new ones. The compact crossover uses an available dual 12.3-inch display setup that spans more than half of the dashboard. The screen on the left acts as a digital gauge cluster, while the one on the right serves as a touchscreen for infotainment and menus. It's an attractive update over the outgoing system, which was beginning to feel dated (entry-level models get the 12.3-inch touchscreen with a 4.2-inch LCD gauge display). We also welcome the addition of wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as an available head-up display. In a laudable move, Hyundai brought back physical dials for the climate control and audio volume that the previous version lacked. We would've appreciated a full return to physical buttons, but we'll settle for the knobs and dedicated space for the haptic icons.

The new interior look is yet another example from Hyundai that practical and attractive interior design doesn't have to break the bank. The new center console adds a second USB-C outlet, and the location of the wireless charging pad (standard on all but the gas SE trim) is now easier to reach on Limited models. The redesigned dashboard has a new storage tray built in, although it could use a more substantial lip to store your items. Four adults can fit comfortably, and our 5-foot-11 driver had plenty of room to spare in the front and rear seats.

Changes to the exterior styling are more subtle than those to the interior. To make the car look wider, Hyundai designers said they stretched the bumpers and fake skid plates on the front and back. The daytime running lights maintain their overall shape, though the number of lights has been reduced from 10 to eight, and the amber markers on the corners are gone. The result is a more upright look that allows the Tucson to hulk just a bit more.

Success can be brash and loud but more often than not, it is a quiet achievement found through boring work. Like an athlete toiling away day after day or a student hitting the books late into the night, the refreshed Tucson succeeds by excelling at the mundane. It's neither the quickest in its class, nor the most fuel-efficient, but the striking looks, confident driving style, and bang-for-your-buck interior make the Hyundai into a compelling package.
