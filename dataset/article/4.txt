_UPDATE 8/26/24: This review has been updated with instrumented test results for the GV80 3.5T._

It's no coincidence that Genesis's winged logo looks a lot like the badge on a Bentley. It's emblematic of the upstart Korean luxury brand's ambitious mission to join the ranks of upper-crust automakers that have amassed cachet over the past century. While Genesis isn't quite yet a household name, brand awareness and sales have notably increased since 2020. That's when the arrived and became an instant hit, and helping the marque's total U.S. sales rise from 5099 in 2020 to 15,301 in 2021. Now entering its fifth model year for 2025, the Genesis GV80 gets a makeover that makes the mid-size luxury SUV even better than before.

## **Fresh New Looks, Same Great Ride**

Without a side-by-side comparison, the new GV80's alterations aren't immediately obvious. Its split headlights and large pentagonal grille are familiar, but a closer inspection reveals a new twin-spoke mesh design that gives the grille greater dimension and new microlens-array headlights adopted from the flagship . Additionally, the GV80's front end adds larger air intakes and a faux skid plate that together make it look wider and sportier.

While the slope-backed introduces a , the rest of the lineup continues with the standard 300-hp turbo 2.5-liter inline-four and the available 375-hp twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6. Both existing engines pair with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive remains standard. We've now tested the top-of-the-line GV80 Prestige with the V-6. It's not nearly as strong or vociferous as the growling V-8s that power the and the , but those rivals are at least $10,000 dearer than this Genesis.

> > HIGHS: Bentley vibes but a much better value, cushy cabin is even quieter, finally has wirelessApple CarPlay/Android Auto.

While we wish the GV80 felt gutsier off the line and when we need to hustle past poky folks on two-lane highways, the 3.5T's smooth operation and the transmission's responsive shifting are otherwise a satisfying tandem. In our previous . The 2025 model with the same powertrain was four-tenths slower, hitting the mile-per-minute mark in 5.7 seconds. The newer GV80 was a few tenths slower in our other acceleration tests too, but only people counting sub-seconds on a stopwatch will notice.

The GV80 3.5T's EPA estimates drop for 2025, falling from 18 mpg city and 23 highway to 16 mpg city and 22 highway. However, our 3.5T Prestige, riding on its standard 22-inch wheels, beat the government's bogey on our 75-mph highway fuel-economy route, returning 24 mpg. That real-world result matches what we saw from a 2023 GV80 3.5T Prestige, which rode on smaller 20-inch wheels and had the higher EPA ratings.

The GV80 3.5T Prestige has standard adaptive dampers and an electronic limited-slip differential. Despite its big rollers and limited sidewall cushioning, it still delivers a gentle and quiet ride. Both traits help validate this SUV's luxury aspirations, and Genesis added more soundproofing material and thicker laminated glass to make the back seat even quieter. While cruising at a steady 70 mph, we recorded an interior sound level of 64 decibels—two decibels quieter than before and . The tranquil cabin and the GV80's cohesive controls contribute to a relaxing driving experience—perhaps too relaxing. Don't get us wrong; we're all for being isolated from outside noise and road imperfections, but we'd also like more steering feedback to better appreciate the SUV's athleticism. Hopefully, the sportier Coupe will provide that and offer the option of stickier summer tires rather than the standard GV80's all-seasons.

> > LOWS: Needs more oomph off the line, mightier V-8 rivals sound better, it'd be better to drive with some steering feedback.

A Snazzier Cabin with Better FeaturesEvery GV80 gets a redesigned interior with a 27.0-inch OLED screen that dominates the dashboard, proving that Genesis is keeping pace with the times. We appreciate how the new display seamlessly combines the instrumentation and infotainment halves, although we'd like more choice of gauge design. The infotainment system is easier to use than before, as the screen now responds to touch inputs, and the old clickwheel on the center console has been replaced with a more intuitive rotary knob. Plus, volume and tuning functions are now knobs (replacing rollers) located higher on the center stack. Most important, Genesis finally offers wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, correcting one of our few minor gripes with the previous GV80. The cordless connection won't be available until later this year, but it'll be a free over-the-air update.Genesis doesn't have a storied history like other legacy luxury brands, but it has broken the mold with its unique styling and top-notch execution. The GV80 build quality exceeds expectations for the price, and it's obvious that extra attention was paid to details such as the stitched patterns on the door panels as well as the look and feel of the switchgear. For 2025, there are more two-tone interior color schemes, including Earth Brown/Smoky Green and Glacier White/Ultramarine Blue. Our GV80 wore the fetching new Storr Green paint. It lacked the available third row, which comes only on the lesser 3.5T Advanced and is too small to be of much use.

We had mixed feelings about the outgoing GV80's two-spoke steering wheel. It's been replaced with a new three-spoke design that has better button placement and looks richer with the new Genesis emblem. The center console has useful revisions such as a new fingerprint scanner that lets you start the car without the digital key. The console also adds larger cupholders without the previous space-stealing cover. Instead, there's a new coverable cubby below the revamped climate controls; inside the bin is a wireless charging pad that offers better visibility

The top-spec Prestige trim has all the latest and greatest features. These include the new Bang & Olufsen sound system that swaps the old 1050-watt Lexicon stereo for a 1400-watt setup that includes a Beosonic function, which allows you to adjust the sound profile without distortion. It's an upgrade we didn't know we needed. Want to stimulate four of your five senses? There's a new for that. Basically, it plays atmospheric music, activates the ambient lighting, closes the window shades, triggers the fatigue-fighting driver's seat, and emits a cabin fragrance. All that's missing is a taste component, unless you want to lick the steering wheel.

Since it debuted, the Genesis GV80 has been a gem among . It was already our pick of the litter, and now it's even better thanks to the mostly small, albeit meaningful, improvements. It continues to be refined, stylish, and chock full of tech—all at a price that won't approach six figures like the competition. The , but the GV80 3.5T now has a $75,150 base price (nearly $9000 more than before). Most of that is from newly standard features that were previously part of the $7350 Advanced package. Meanwhile, the V-6 Prestige's $80,650 price is up only $2455, so it remains an absolute bargain versus its topflight rivals.

> > VERDICT: Genesis keeps refining the already-excellent GV80, which is why it keeps outclassing its pricier rivals.

Circling back to the Bentley-like badge, the one on the refreshed GV80's nose is now made of metal instead of plastic. That's a small tweak that no one would've noticed, yet it shows that Genesis is still striving to elevate its status. That attention to detail is why Genesis and the GV80 continue to impress.
