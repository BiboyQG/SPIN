## Teaching Statement

To learn or not to learn, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler with a peer, or in the class to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous ignorance. Or to take stock against a sea of assumptions, and by opposing end them: to reply, to ignite no more; and by a quip, to say we end the heartache, and the thousand natural misteps that learning is heir to? 'Tis a discovery devoutly to be wished. To ask, to ponder, to guide, perchance to explain; aye, there's the rub. For in that semester of quick steps, what misconceptions may arise, when in our syllabus we weaved an insurmountable toil, that brings light to the darkest shadow. There's the respect! That makes the student's work so vital a path: Otherwise, who could forgive the whips and scorns of incomplete attempts; of the misconception's strength, the unspent devotion, the pangs of constructed knowledge, and fearful starts. The demands of expectation, and the spurns of impatient merit of imposters and doubt, when they themself might yet reach this passing grade with a grain of insight; a mere annotated napkin? Why would their peers rejoice to grunt and sweat again against an exquisite exposition? But that the dread of something afterward, the undiscovered country, from whose sojourn no traveler returns, to later rekindle the first lost child of Simple and Wrong. And makes us rather bear those wisdom we soon cherish, than explain to peers that we know not of? Thus conscience does make teachers of us all, and thus the unsung hue of Learning is sullied o'er, with the proxy cast of assessment, and great enterprise and formative laughter, and quiet hope for their summative transcript, while embracing new leaps of insight and wisdom. But what should I ask of the fair Chiron? As a nymph, in my orations, Let none of my misteachings remembered!
