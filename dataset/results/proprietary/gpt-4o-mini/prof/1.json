He received a BS from National Taiwan University and PhD from Stanford University in Electrical Engineering. His research addresses large-scale information access and knowledge acquisition, for search, mining, and integration across structured and unstructured big data, with current focuses on Web search/mining and social media analytics. He received ICDE 10-Year Test of Time Award in 2022 and Best Paper Selection/Awards in VLDB 2000 and 2013 and ASONAM 2019, NSF CAREER Award in 2002, NCSA Faculty Fellow Award in 2003, IBM Faculty Awards in 2004 and 2005, Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Faculty Fellow Award in 2008, and the Incomplete List of Excellent Teachers at University of Illinois in 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2019, 2022, 2023. He is passionate to bring research results to the real world and, with his students, co-founded Cazoodle, a startup from the University of Illinois, and developed GrantForward.com funding discovery and dissemination service, a vertical search engine integrating 20,000 sources, subscribed by 200+ institutions including Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Cornell University, University of California, CMU, Mayo Clinic, and National Institutes of Health.", "professionalHighlights": [{"position": "PC Member", "organization": "SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, KDD, EDBT, ICDM, WWW, ASONAM, SIGIR, WSDM, CIKM, AAAI", "yearStart": 2010, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Area Chair", "organization": "NeurIPS", "yearStart": 2023, "yearEnd": 2023}, {"position": "Associate Editor", "organization": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB)", "yearStart": 2014, "yearEnd": 2015}, {"position": "Area Editor", "organization": "Encyclopedia of Database Systems", "yearStart": 2014, "yearEnd": 2016}, {"position": "Workshop Co-chair", "organization": "31st IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2015)", "yearStart": 2014, "yearEnd": 2015}, {"position": "Associate Editor", "organization": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)", "yearStart": 2013, "yearEnd": 2017}, {"position": "Workshop Co-chair", "organization": "22nd International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2014)", "yearStart": 2013, "yearEnd": 2014}, {"position": "PC Co-chair", "organization": "Track \u201cBringing Unstructured and Structured Data\u201d", "yearStart": 2012, "yearEnd": 2013}, {"position": "Best Paper Award Committee", "organization": "ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining", "yearStart": 2012, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Senior PC", "organization": "ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining", "yearStart": 2011, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Co-chair", "organization": "Demonstration Track, ICDE 2011", "yearStart": 2011, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Senior PC", "organization": "ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining", "yearStart": 2010, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Area Editor", "organization": "Encyclopedia of Database Systems", "yearStart": 2007, "yearEnd": 2009}, {"position": "Workshop Chair", "organization": "APWeb", "yearStart": 2007, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Steering Committee", "organization": "International Workshop on Information Integration on the Web (IIWeb 2007) at AAAI", "yearStart": 2007, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Workshop Chair", "organization": "ACM SIGMOD 2006 Conference", "yearStart": 2006, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Co-chair", "organization": "International Workshop on Information Integration on the Web (IIWeb 2006) at WWW", "yearStart": 2006, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Co-chair", "organization": "International Workshop on Challenges in Web Information Retrieval and Integration (WIRI 2006) at ICDE", "yearStart": 2006, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Guest Editor", "organization": "SIGKDD Explorations 6(2) Special Issue on Web Content Mining", "yearStart": 2004, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Chair", "organization": "NSF DIMACS Center Tutorial/Summer School on Social Choice and Computer Science", "yearStart": 2004, "yearEnd": null}], "researchStatement": "I lead the FORWARD Data Lab group, which is part of the larger Data and Information Systems Laboratories, at the CS department of UIUC. Our research overall aims at bridging structured and unstructured data\u2014to bring structured/semantic-rich access to the myriad and massive unstructured data which accounts for most of the world\u2019s information. Therefore, our research spans natural language processing, data mining, data management/databases, information retrieval, and machine learning. As our objectives, we aim at developing novel systems, principled algorithms, and formal theories that ultimately deliver real-world applications. As our approaches, we seek to be inspired by and learn from the data we are tackling-- i.e., we believe the key to tame big data is to learn the wisdom hidden in the large scale of the data.",
