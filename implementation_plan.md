  - [x] Brave Search API integration
  - [x] Query generation and rewriting
  - [x] Result parsing and normalization

### Phase 3: Action System

- [x] Implement `ActionPlanner` class
  - [x] State-based action selection
  - [x] Action prioritization logic
  - [x] Budget and constraint checking
- [x] Implement action executors
  - [x] SEARCH action executor
  - [x] VISIT action executor
  - [x] REFLECT action executor
  - [x] EXTRACT action executor
  - [x] EVALUATE action executor

### Phase 4: Evaluation Engine

  - [x] Completeness evaluation
  - [x] Accuracy assessment
  - [x] Consistency checking
  - [x] Freshness validation
- [x] Create evaluation criteria and thresholds
- [x] Implement multi-level evaluation system

### Phase 5: Main Research Agent

- [x] Implement `ResearchAgent` class
  - [x] Main research orchestration loop
  - [x] State management
  - [x] Action execution coordination
  - [x] Final result compilation
- [x] Integrate all components
- [x] Add progress tracking and reporting

### Phase 6: API and Interface

- [ ] Create FastAPI-based REST API
  - [ ] `/research` endpoint for initiating research
  - [ ] `/status/{task_id}` for progress tracking
  - [ ] `/schemas` for schema management
- [ ] Implement async task management
- [ ] Add request/response models

### Phase 7: Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Write unit tests for core components
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 8: Advanced Features

- [ ] Implement caching system
- [ ] Add concurrent research support
- [ ] Create monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Build schema extension system

## Implementation Order

1. Start with core data structures and infrastructure
2. Build individual components bottom-up
3. Integrate components into the research flow
4. Add API layer
5. Test and optimize

## Key Design Decisions

- Use async/await for concurrent operations
- Implement clear separation of concerns
- Make components pluggable and extensible
- Focus on robustness and error recovery
- Maintain detailed research trail for transparency
