    "biography": "Yuxiong Wang is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). His research focuses on computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, with a specific emphasis on open-world perception, meta-learning, multi-modal learning, generative modeling, and agent learning. Before joining Illinois CS, he was a postdoctoral fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Martial Hebert. He has also worked with Prof. Jean Ponce at the Center for Data Science at New York University and has collaborated with Prof. Deva Ramanan and Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov. He has received several awards, including the Best Paper Honorable Mention Award for streaming perception in ECCV 2020 and Best Paper Award Finalist in CVPR 2019, 2022. He is recognized as a Notable Area Chair in ICLR 2023 and an Expert Reviewer in TMLR. He is also selected to participate in the National Academy of Engineering\u2019s (NAE) Frontiers of Engineering symposium.",
