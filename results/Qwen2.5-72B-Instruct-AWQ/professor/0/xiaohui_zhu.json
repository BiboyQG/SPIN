He is currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU). Before joining XJTLU, he was an associate professor at Nantong University, China. He has taught a wide range of modules including Introduction to Databases, C++ Programming, Foundation of Java Programming, C# Programming and Data Structure. From 2011 to 2017, he visited several European universities for academic exchange such as the University of Bedfordshire in the UK, the University of Edinburgh in the UK, the Tampere University of Technology in Finland and the University of Oldenburg in Germany. Dr. Zhu\u2019s research interests include Artificial intelligence and its application, especially in multi-objective optimization, autonomous navigation and collision avoidance, fast path planning, and USV-related algorithms and applications.
