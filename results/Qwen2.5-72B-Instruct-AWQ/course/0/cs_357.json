{"code": "CS 357", "title": "Numerical Methods I", "credits": 3, "description": "This course introduces the fundamentals of scientific computing and numerical methods, with theoretical algorithms supplemented with hands-on programming exercises. Numerical simulations are only useful when they are accurate and reliable; hence we will learn how to understand the error in scientific computing, particularly the effects of representing real numbers with a finite amount of memory in the form of floating-point numbers. This is just as important as the understanding of the algorithms themselves!", "semester": "Fall", "year": 2023, "instructors": [{"name": "Instructor", "email": "instructor@illinois.edu", "officeHours": null, "officeLocation": null}], "teachingAssistants": [{"name": "Teaching Assistant", "email": "ta@illinois.edu", "officeHours": null, "officeLocation": null}], "schedule": [], "prerequisites": null, "textbooks": null, "gradingComponents": [], "syllabusLink": "https://cs357.cs.illinois.edu/pages/syllabus.html", "department": "Computer Science", "learningObjectives": ["Analyze the sources of errors in mathematical operations on the computer", "Recognize major numerical methods and their merits and pitfalls", "Calculate the computational cost of a range of numerical methods", "Select and use software tools, based on their numerical methods, for a range of problems", "Estimate the accuracy in approximated numerical solutions"]}
