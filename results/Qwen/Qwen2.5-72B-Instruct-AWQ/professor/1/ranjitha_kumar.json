I run the Data Driven Design Group, where we research machine learning for effective user experiences and effective user experiences for machine learning. I also serve as the Chief Research Scientist at UserTesting, where my team and I are building solutions for bridging quantitative and qualitative experience testing. Based on my dissertation work, I co-founded Apropose, Inc., a data-driven design startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz and New Enterprise Associates. Since joining Illinois CS in 2014, I have sought out the right way to make meaningful commercial impact. With more than eight product releases in three years with UserTesting, my productivity altered the relationship between business, user experience, and customer. My interest in UserTesting grew from its dedication to human insight, which the company describes as offering a valuable understanding of customers that result from listening and observing with empathy and can be used to connect the dots between what they think, feel, say, and do. It provides the 'why' context that gives organizations the ability to understand customer needs and rethink ways to better serve them.", "professionalHighlights": [{"position": "Director of the Innovation Leadership and Engineering Entrepreneurship (ILEE) Program", "organization": "Grainger College of Engineering", "yearStart": 2023, "yearEnd": null}], "researchStatement": "My research focuses on applying data mining and machine learning to user experience design, with the goal of bringing about a new era of data-driven design: tying design decisions to desired outcomes. I have developed an interaction mining system and have been involved in the creation of several product features at UserTesting, including Interactive Path Flows, machine-learning powered data visualizations, Instant Insight, and Friction Detection for enhanced behavioral analytics. I am excited about leveraging technology to bring everyone in an organization closer to understanding their customer.", "researchInterests": [{"area": "Machine Learning for Effective User Experiences", "description": "Researching how machine learning can be used to create more effective user experiences."}, {"area": "Effective User Experiences for Machine Learning", "description": "Designing user experiences that facilitate the use of machine learning in various applications."}], "researchAreas": ["Interactive Computing"], "publications": [], "teachingHonors": [], "researchHonors": [], "coursesTaught": [{"code": "CS 199 US", "title": "Underground Unicorn Seminar"}, {"code": "CS 409 (CS 498 RK1, CS 498 RK2)", "title": "The Art of Web Programming"}, {"code": "CS 498 RK1 (CS 498 RK2, CS 498 RK3, CS 498 RK4)", "title": "Art and Science of Web Prog"}, {"code": "CS 568", "title": "User-Centered Machine Learning"}, {"code": "CS 598 RK", "title": "HCI for ML"}, {"code": "TE 100", "title": "Intro to ILEE"}, {"code": "TE 333", "title": "Creativity, Innovation, Vision"}, {"code": "TE 440", "title": "Engineering City Scholars"}]}
