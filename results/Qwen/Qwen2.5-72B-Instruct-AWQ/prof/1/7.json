More professionally, I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I'm also affiliated with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UIUC. Before joining UIUC, I spent a year at Facebook's Core Systems, working on dealing with datacenter failures and eating free food. I spent six wonderful years at sysnet at the University of California San Diego until my rock star advisor kicked me out. I worked with NetApp to study production data ontap. I had a short experience at Whova where I learned dedication. I worked in Germany at Goettingen and backpacked Europe for 1.5 years before starting my grad school. As a 'professor', my meta-advice is to be serious and sincere to life and work. Winter is coming! Don't fight a fake war or someone else's war. Fight for what matters to the living or the dead. I am a part of CS CARES. If you need help, please don't hesitate to reach out -- you'll never walk alone.", "professionalHighlights": [{"position": "Assistant Professor", "organization": "Siebel School of Computing and Data Science, Illinois", "yearStart": 0, "yearEnd": null}], "researchStatement": "The goal of my research is to make computer systems reliable and secure, especially those operating at the cloud and datacenter scale. My mission is to help today's systems defend against all kinds of errors and defects, such as software bugs, configuration errors, and design flaws. I am very happy that some of our work helps improve reliability of real-world systems (check out bugs we detected/fixed). I am interested in all kinds of black magic. My view of systems research is to build the right swords to fight the dragon (not windmills).", "researchInterests": [{"area": "Programming Languages / Formal Methods / Software Engineering", "description": ""}, {"area": "Systems and Networking", "description": ""}], "researchAreas": ["Programming Languages / Formal Methods / Software Engineering", "Systems and Networking"], "publications": [{"title": "CS professor Tianyin Xu and team develop a 'push button' for testing cloud systems", "authors": ["Tianyin Xu"], "conference": "Siebel School of Computing and Data Science, Illinois", "year": 2023}, {"title": "CS professors contribute to evaluation of new Intel server chips", "authors": ["Tianyin Xu"], "conference": "Siebel School of Computing and Data Science, Illinois", "year": 2023}], "teachingHonors": [{"honor": "2024 Dean\u2019s Award for Excellence in Research for Assistant Professor", "year": 2024}], "researchHonors": [{"honor": "2024 Dean\u2019s Award for Excellence in Research for Assistant Professor", "organization": "The Grainger College of Engineering", "year": 2024}], "coursesTaught": [{"code": "CS 423 (CSE 423)", "title": "Operating Systems Design"}, {"code": "CS 523", "title": "Advanced Operating Systems"}, {"code": "CS 591 DS (CS 591 IG)", "title": "Distributed Systems Seminar"}, {"code": "CS 591 IG", "title": "ADV Sem in Distributed Systems"}, {"code": "CS 591 SE", "title": "SOFTWARE ENGINEER.
