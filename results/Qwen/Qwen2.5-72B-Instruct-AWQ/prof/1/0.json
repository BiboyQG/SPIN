He received his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley in 2007. His research focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of distributed systems and networks on the extremely large scale, with an emphasis on network operations, measurement, and availability. He is particularly interested in improving availability and performance of the Internet infrastructure, including routing, DNS, and data centers. Matthew has a long history of successful technology transfer, including his startup company Veriflow, which was sold to VMware in 2019. He has received several awards, including the NSF CAREER award (2011), DARPA CSSG membership (2011), CAS Fellow (2013), and IEEE Fellow (2023).", "professionalHighlights": [{"position": "Chair", "organization": "ACM SIGCOMM", "yearStart": 2023, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Co-Chair", "organization": "The Networking Channel", "yearStart": 2023, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Co-Principal Investigator", "organization": "TSCP-DC project at UIUC's IARCS center in Singapore", "yearStart": 2023, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Engineer", "organization": "Nokia, Diamond Lane, HP", "yearStart": 2000, "yearEnd": 2003}, {"position": "Professor", "organization": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "yearStart": 2007, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Professor", "organization": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "yearStart": 2019, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Researcher", "organization": "Coordinated Science Laboratory at Illinois", "yearStart": 2020, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Researcher", "organization": "Information Trust Institute", "yearStart": 2020, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Researcher", "organization": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "yearStart": 2020, "yearEnd": null}], "researchStatement": "Simplifying management and improving reliability of distributed systems and networks through principles of self-organization and self-diagnosis, with an emphasis on wide-area networks and networked systems.
