    "biography": "Matthew Caesar is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He received his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley in 2007. He currently serves as Chair of ACM SIGCOMM, co-founder and organizing committee member of the Networking Channel, and co-Principal Investigator of the $25M TSCP-DC project at UIUC's IARCS center in Singapore. Prior to his Ph.D, he spent several years as an engineer in the telecom sector (Nokia, Diamond Lane, HP). He has worked in the area of networked systems for over two decades, publishing over 50 technical papers, which appear in highly selective academic conferences and have resulted in multiple best paper awards. Matthew has led over $10M in research initiatives in this space, including a $2.4M DARPA MRC initiative on next-generation security for cloud networking. He received the NSF CAREER award (2011), DARPA CSSG membership (2011), is a CAS Fellow (2013), an IEEE Fellow (2023) and received Test of Time Awards from SIGSIM-PADS for his landmark work on distributed time synchronization, and the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation for his foundational contributions to software-defined networking. Matthew has a long history of successful technology transfer. His startup company Veriflow produced the first practical network verification system and was sold to VMware in 2019. At AT&T he co-developed the Routing Control Platform, a route management technology which was deployed on their North American IP backbone. At Microsoft, he co-developed Virtual Ring Routing, which was incorporated as part of the mesh connectivity layer in Microsoft Windows. Matthew has worked extensively with the US Department of Defense, through participation in the DARPA CSSG program, and holds a Top Secret security clearance. Matthew has also served as an expert witness in multiple high-profile litigations on behalf of networking technology users, and teaches students across the world through his MOOC as well as in-person outreach classes at universities in East Asia.",
