    "description": "This course introduces the fundamentals of scientific computing and numerical methods, with theoretical algorithms supplemented with hands-on programming exercises. Numerical simulations are only useful when they are accurate and reliable; hence we will learn how to understand the error in scientific computing, particularly the effects of representing real numbers with a finite amount of memory in the form of floating-point numbers. This is just as important as the understanding of the algorithms themselves!",
