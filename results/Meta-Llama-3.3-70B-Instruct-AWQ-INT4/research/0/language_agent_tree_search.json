Drawing inspiration from Monte Carlo tree search in model-based reinforcement learning, LATS employs LLMs as agents, value functions, and optimizers, repurposing their latent strengths for enhanced decision-making.", "keywords": ["Language Models", "Reasoning", "Acting", "Planning", "Decision-Making"], "problemStatement": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a range of decision-making tasks, but they rely on simple acting processes and fall short of broad deployment as autonomous agents.", "methodology": "LATS employs LLMs as agents, value functions, and optimizers, repurposing their latent strengths for enhanced decision-making. The method uses an environment for external feedback, which offers a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism that moves beyond the limitations of existing techniques.", "contributions": ["LATS achieves 94.4% for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4", "LATS achieves an average score of 75.9 for web browsing on WebShop with GPT-3.5"], "implementation": {"language": "Python", "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/andyz245/LanguageAgentTreeSearch", "documentationUrl": null, "requirements": ["Python", "Transformers", "PyTorch"]}, "dataset": {"name": "HumanEval", "description": "A benchmark for evaluating the performance of language models on programming tasks"}, "researchOutput": {"conference": "ICML 2024", "metrics": {"accuracy": 0.944, "f1_score": 0.759}}, "primaryCitation": {"title": "Language Agent Tree Search Unifies Reasoning Acting and Planning in Language Models", "authors": ["Andy Zhou", "Kai Yan", "Michal Shlapentokh-Rothman", "Haohan Wang", "Yu-Xiong Wang"], "venue": "arXiv", "year": 2023, "doi": null, "citationsCount": null}, "relatedPublications": [], "status": "completed", "startDate": "2022-01-01", "endDate": "2023-12-31", "fundingSources": ["University of Illinois"]}
