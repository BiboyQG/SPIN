    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are shown to possess a wealth of actionable knowledge that can be extracted for robot manipulation in the form of reasoning and planning. Despite the progress, most still rely on pre-defined motion primitives to carry out the physical interactions with the environment, which remains a major bottleneck. In this work, we aim to synthesize robot trajectories, i.e., a dense sequence of 6-DoF end-effector waypoints, for a large variety of manipulation tasks given an open-set of instructions and an open-set of objects.",

    "problemStatement": "Most current methods for robotic manipulation rely on pre-defined motion primitives, which limits their ability to handle open-set instructions and objects.",
    "methodology": "We propose a framework that uses large language models to extract affordances and constraints from language instructions and compose 3D value maps, which are then used in a model-based planning framework to synthesize robot trajectories.",
