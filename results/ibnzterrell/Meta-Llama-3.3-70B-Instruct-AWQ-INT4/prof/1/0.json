His research focuses on improving the robustness of computer systems and networks through principles of softwarization and programmability. He is also passionate about the Internet of Things (IoT) and has developed a series of graduate-level courses on the subject, including a hands-on Coursera specialization. Recently, he has been working on a project to improve internet connectivity during disaster response using drones.", "professionalHighlights": [{"position": "Associate Professor", "organization": "University of Illinois", "yearStart": 0, "yearEnd": 0}, {"position": "Chair", "organization": "ACM SIGCOMM", "yearStart": 0, "yearEnd": 0}, {"position": "Co-chair", "organization": "The Networking Channel", "yearStart": 0, "yearEnd": 0}, {"position": "Chief Science Officer and President", "organization": "Veriflow", "yearStart": 0, "yearEnd": 2019}], "researchStatement": "My research focuses on improving the robustness of computer systems and networks through principles of softwarization and programmability, enabling the use of techniques from the field of software engineering and AI to build highly functional and reliable systems. I am currently working on a project to develop a drone-based system for providing internet connectivity during disaster response. This project involves the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict where internet connectivity is needed and to deploy drones to provide coverage. The goal of this project is to provide vital internet connectivity to disaster-stricken areas, enabling emergency responders to communicate and coordinate their efforts more effectively.", "researchInterests": [{"area": "Simplifying management and improving reliability of distributed systems and networks", "description": "through principles of self-organization and self-diagnosis, with an emphasis on wide-area networks and networked systems."}, {"area": "Distributed systems and networks", "description": "with an emphasis on network operations, measurement, and availability."}, {"area": "Softwarization and programmability", "description": "enabling the use of techniques from the field of software engineering and AI to build highly functional and reliable systems."}, {"area": "Internet of Things (IoT)", "description": "including the development of IoT systems, IoT security, and the application of IoT to real-world problems."}], "researchAreas": ["Security and Privacy", "Systems and Networking", "Internet of Things (IoT)"], "publications": [{"title": "", "authors": [""], "conference": "", "year": 0}], "teachingHonors": [{"honor": "", "year": 0}], "researchHonors": [{"honor": "IEEE Fellow", "organization": "IEEE", "year": 2024}], "coursesTaught": [{"code": "CS 498IT", "title": "Internet of Things"}, {"code": "CS 436", "title": "Systems and Networking Laboratory"}, {"code": "CS 598", "title": "Network Security"}, {"code": "CS 591AoS", "title": "Acting Out Algorithms"}, {"code": "CS 438", "title": "Communication Networks"}, {"code": "CS 241", "title": "System Programming"}, {"code": "CS 498IT - Hands-on Internet of Things Specialization", "title": "Hands-on Internet of Things Specialization"}]}
