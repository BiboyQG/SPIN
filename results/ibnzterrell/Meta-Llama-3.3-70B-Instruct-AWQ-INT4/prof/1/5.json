Before joining CS@Illinois in 2017, she was a lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering at the same university for five years. Silva holds a Bachelor\u2019s and a Master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and earned a PhD in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from the University of Illinois in 2009. Her doctoral research focused on the theory, computation, and design optimization of systems governed by partial differential equations, addressing challenges in structural topology optimization, material design, energy mitigation, fracture mechanics, and robust optimization. Recently, she collaborated with Professor Eric Shaffer on an outreach opportunity with Campus Middle School for Girls, where they taught video game design and development to 11 students, and saw the students\u2019 designs come to life with the help of Illinois CS students. She is leading a team that has received a $300,000 grant from the National Science Foundation\u2019s Division of Undergraduate Education to explore the interconnections between online learning, equity, and access.", "professionalHighlights": [{"position": "Teaching Associate Professor", "organization": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "yearStart": 2020, "yearEnd": null}, {"position": "Teaching Assistant Professor", "organization": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "yearStart": 2017, "yearEnd": 2020}, {"position": "Curriculum Development Coordinator", "organization": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "yearStart": 2014, "yearEnd": 2017}, {"position": "Visiting Lecturer", "organization": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "yearStart": 2012, "yearEnd": 2014}, {"position": "Postdoctoral Research Assistant", "organization": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "yearStart": 2010, "yearEnd": 2012}, {"position": "Graduate Research Assistant", "organization": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "yearStart": 2003, "yearEnd": 2009}], "researchStatement": "My research explores the development and application of educational technologies to enhance computer-based assessments and centralized computer-based testing centers.
