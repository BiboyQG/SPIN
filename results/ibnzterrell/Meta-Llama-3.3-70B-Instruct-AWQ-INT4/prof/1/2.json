There are two things that I feel very important in my career, one is I think learning is a life long journey, the other is there are always surprises and we must embrace changes. For example when I received my B. E. in Precision Machinery and Instrumentation from the Univ. of Science and Technology of China I didn\u2019t expect at all I would get my PhD from MIT in the area of computer aided design for 3-D Printing\u2014 because there was not even AutoCAD in my college years. After my doctoral studies, I was drawn to the area of Biomedical research due to both my interest in helping cure diseases and my new found faith. In the years I spent in Boston Longwood Area, I have done research in diverse Data Science related areas such as Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, Biostatistics, and Machine learning. Over a 4-year period of encountering/interacting with students, reviewing academic works and college teaching, I discovered I feel happiest when I work with undergraduate students and I enjoy teaching undergraduate students and training next generation of computer scientists and data-centered professionals. I am passionate about mentoring undergraduate students and helping undergraduate students do research. My research is focused on understanding the needs of students with disabilities and broadening the participation of students with disabilities. I am currently PI of two projects at the Univ. of Illinois on helping students with disabilities and PI of a project on exploring UDL in teaching STEM courses. The projects are: SIIP project \"UDL based best practices including utilizing Canvas for the needs of students with disability\"; GIANT project \"Applying a Theoretical Understanding of Text-Based Learning Modalities To Develop New Course Modalities That Meet the Needs of Student With Disabilities\". Other interests include Biomedical applications that involve large high dimensional data analysis and machine learning and data-driven educational improvement for undergraduate students.", "professionalHighlights": [{"position": "Faculty Spotlight", "organization": "SIIP ENGINE project", "yearStart": 0, "yearEnd": 0}], "researchStatement": "My research focuses on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, with an emphasis on understanding the needs of students with disabilities and broadening their participation.
