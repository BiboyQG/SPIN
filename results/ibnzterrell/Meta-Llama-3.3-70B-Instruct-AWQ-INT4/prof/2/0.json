His research focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of distributed systems and networks on the extremely large scale, with an emphasis on network operations, measurement, and availability. He is particularly interested in improving availability and performance of the Internet infrastructure, including routing, DNS, and data centers. His research also focuses on simplifying management and improving reliability of distributed systems and networks through principles of self-organization and self-diagnosis, with an emphasis on wide-area networks and networked systems. He has a passion for IoT and has developed a series of graduate-level courses on the subject, including a hands-on Coursera specialization. He is currently working on a project to improve internet connectivity during disaster response using drones.", "professionalHighlights": [{"position": "Professor", "organization": "University of Illinois", "yearStart": 0, "yearEnd": 0}], "researchStatement": "My research focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of distributed systems and networks on the extremely large scale, with an emphasis on network operations, measurement, and availability.
