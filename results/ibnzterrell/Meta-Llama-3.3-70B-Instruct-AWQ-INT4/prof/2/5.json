This includes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the grading of short-answer questions and to design robust, randomized question generators that support innovative and scalable assessment practices. I am also leading a team that has received a $300,000 grant from the National Science Foundation\u2019s Division of Undergraduate Education to explore the interconnections between online learning, equity, and access. The project aims to establish best practices to increase access to high-quality education for all students regardless of where they live. The research will investigate the impact of students\u2019 choice of synchronous or asynchronous classes on their learning goals, sense of belonging, and satisfaction. Additionally, the project will develop online strategies for collaborative learning that are adapted from evidence-based face-to-face facilitation strategies, including the use of group awareness tools and designated team roles.", "researchInterests": [{"area": "Fostering collaborations and group work during programming activities", "description": ""}, {"area": "Exploration of technological innovations for large-scale teaching, such as the development of online course assessments.", "description": ""}], "researchAreas": ["Computers and Education"], "publications": [{"title": "Frequent mastery testing with second-chance exams leads to enhanced student learning in undergraduate STEM", "authors": ["Morphew J.", "Silva M.", "Herman G.", "West M."], "conference": "Applied Cognitive Psychology", "year": 2019}, {"title": "Minmax topology optimization", "authors": ["Brittain, K.", "M.
