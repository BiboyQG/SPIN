    "biography": "Matthew Caesar, a professor of computer science, was elevated \u201cfor contributions to computer network verification and routing.\u201d He performed foundational work in network verification, or determining whether a computer network has technical flaws or security holes. His work on mathematically modelling networks and developing tools for fast verification is being adopted by Cisco, Google, Microsoft and VMware. He has now turned his attention to \u201cnetwork synthesis,\u201d which aims to construct computer networks that are fundamentally immune to certain kinds of errors. He earned a doctorate in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley in 2007. He co-founded Veriflow, which was sold to VMware in 2019. At AT&T, he co-developed the Routing Control Platform, a route management technology which remains in daily use in their North American IP backbone. He is a member of the DARPA Computer Science Study Group, and he has received the \u201cTest of Time Award\u201d from the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation. He is also affiliated with the department of electrical & computer engineering, the Coordinated Science Laboratory and the Information Trust Institute at the U. of I. I serve as the Chair of ACM SIGCOMM, and the co-chair of The Networking Channel. I co-founded and previously served as the Chief Science Officer and President of Veriflow (sold to VMware in 2019).",
